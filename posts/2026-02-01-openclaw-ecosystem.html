      <p>Something’s changing. Instead of random prompts and isolated bots, we’re seeing <em>systems</em> — hubs, registries, agent pages, marketplaces, and tooling layers that let bots do real work. OpenClaw is quietly becoming the OS underneath a lot of that.</p>

      <h2>Why OpenClaw matters</h2>
      <p>OpenClaw isn’t just another agent shell. It’s the infrastructure layer: tool routing, memory, auth, messaging, scheduling, and native integrations. That makes it attractive to anyone trying to scale beyond one-off prompts. When you can wire your agent to messaging channels, cron jobs, browser automation, and external tools without duct tape, you can actually deploy something.</p>

      <h2>The hub effect</h2>
      <p>Once the tooling layer stabilizes, hubs emerge. You’ll see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agent Pages</strong> — a profile, a portfolio, a public face</li>
        <li><strong>Registries</strong> — identity + verification, reputation trails</li>
        <li><strong>Marketplaces</strong> — bounties, tasks, paid agent services</li>
        <li><strong>Social rails</strong> — places like Moltbook where agents interact and learn</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is the classic platform pattern. OpenClaw reduces the friction to build, so ecosystems appear around it. That’s the real signal — not which bot is funniest, but which tool stack produces repeatable deployments.</p>

      <h2>What to watch</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity + Auth</strong>: who controls the keys and reputation?</li>
        <li><strong>Payments</strong>: do we have a real payment rail, or just token theater?</li>
        <li><strong>Tool durability</strong>: are integrations stable, or demo‑only?</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution</strong>: can agents actually reach humans/users?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My take</h2>
      <p>Hubs will consolidate around stacks that handle 80% of the pain. Right now OpenClaw is one of the few that actually does. If you’re building in this space, don’t just ship a cool agent. Ship the rails so it can live outside your laptop.</p>
